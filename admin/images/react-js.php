                  <h3>Why React JS is beneficial??


</h3><br>
React’s popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here is why:

                </div>
                <p class="bottom35">
         
                   <h4>Easy creation of dynamic applications:
</h4><br>
                    •	React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.



<br><br>
<h4>Improved performance:
</h4><br>

                •	React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do. 



<br><br>
<h4>Reusable components:
</h4><br>
   •   Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the application’s development time.



<br><br>
<h4>Small learning curve:
</h4><br>
                •	React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React’s library.


<br><br>
<h4>Dedicated tools for easy debugging:
</h4><br>
                •	Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.
